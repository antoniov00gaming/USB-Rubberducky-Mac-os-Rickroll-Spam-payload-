# USB-Rubberducky-Mac-os-Rickroll-Spam-payload-
This rickroll has everything you need to rickroll somebody on mac os. No need to compile.
For the Pi pico. Use either multiple rickrolls.dd or single rickroll.dd rename the file to payload.dd after pasting into usb. For the Official Hak5 version use multiplerickrolls.bin or singlerickorll.bin and rename to inject.bin after copying to the SD. Enjoy! I am not responsible for damages caused by this payload.
